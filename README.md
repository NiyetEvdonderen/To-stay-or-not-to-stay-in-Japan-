Analyzing the duration of stay reveals that students typically leave Japan upon completing their education. Only 7 students have resided in Japan for five years or more. Notably, students who stayed for six years or longer exhibit lower scores on the cultural adaptation index regarding difficulties encountered. However, two individuals who resided for 8 and 10 years respectively show higher depression levels compared to the overall sample. Meanwhile, no significant differences are observed within the sample concerning sociability scores. Cultural incompatibility could thus be considered a potential factor influencing their decision to leave the country.
