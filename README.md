# Does attending university abroad influence students' mental health? 
# A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published the results the following year, following approval from multiple ethical and regulatory boards.
# This study highlighted that international students generally face a higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties compared to the general population. 
# Specifically, I investigated whether international students demonstrate similar mental health trends and examined if the duration of their stay in Japan contributes significantly to these outcomes.
# Analyzing the duration of stay reveals that students typically leave Japan upon completing their education. 
# Only 7 out of 206 students have resided in Japan for five years or more. Notably, students who stayed for six years or longer exhibit lower scores on the cultural adaptation index regarding difficulties encountered. 
# However, two individuals who resided for 8 and 10 years respectively show higher depression levels compared to the overall sample. 
# Meanwhile, no significant differences are observed within the sample concerning sociability scores. 
# The study shows that the cultural incompatibility is a potential factor influencing their decision to leave the country.
